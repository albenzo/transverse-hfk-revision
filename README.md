# transverse-hfk-revision
This is a cleanup of the transverseHFK.c to compute the invariant defined in 
"Legendrian knots, transverse knots, and combinatorial Floer homology" by 
P. S. Ozsvath, Z. Szabo, and D. P. Thurston. The original code is from that 
linked in the paper "Transverse knots distinguished by Knot Floer Homology" 
by L. Ng, P. S. Ozsvath, and D. P. Thurston.
